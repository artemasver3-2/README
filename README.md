Hello, and welcome to this potentially awkward and probably too long introduction of myself. 

I'm never any good at these things. 

What should I say?

Well, Hi. 

I'm Heidi. I am a thirty one year old single mother living in the Southern USA. I enjoy spending time with my son, working towards our future, and the occasional glass of wine after a hard day. That's not really what you're here to learn though, is it? 

I started coding about a year ago, officially. I kind of played around with html and css when I was a kid, I mean, everyone did their own myspace layouts right? I got pretty good at what I know now is the baseline for coding, and I'll admit to being pretty proud of my overly crowded and animated profile page. However, having been in school for coding this last year, I realize it's not just html and css anymore. I was wholly mistaken that it would be an easy ride to learn how to code, and so, in the last year, I have come quite a long way from god awful myspace pages. I have learned Javascript, and base Base React as of this moment, and look forward to learning, and continuing to learn.
