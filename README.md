# README
Hi, my name is Heidi Gunter. I am a full stack web development student who has just about technically finished her program. I have been coding for two years and I have learned multiple languages, including JavaScript, React, and HTML. I have an unmatched love for using CSS and Styled Compenents in React, though I plan to learn more languages on my own now that I have a good basis on how to learn them and what to do once I have a good handle on something. I know coding is something that takes time and effort, and I hope to have more of that in my journey forwards. 

I love coding, it's like solving problems. It often times makes me want to rip every hair from my head piece by piece, but there is a feeling that comes with finally getting running code that I have not yet truly matched any other way. I have had such a long journey so far, full of trails and tribulations that only the chaos of life can bring, but I am so proud of myself for seeing it through, even if the end, the middle, and the start of it has been like pulling teeth at times. Coding is not for the faint of heart, something someone should have warned me about way before I started my journey. 

Might have done a world of good for me to be better prepared; still, even if the road is long and winding, I will hope to walk it with the same dedication.
